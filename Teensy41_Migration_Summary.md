# ADS1256 Project Migration: Teensy 3.1 → Teensy 4.1

## ✅ Migration Complete!

Your ADS1256 project has been successfully updated for Teensy 4.1 compatibility.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Pin Assignments Updated
- **CS Pin**: Changed from Pin 21 → Pin 10 (Teensy 4.1 default SPI CS)
- **SPI Pins**: Confirmed Pin 13 (SCK), Pin 11 (MOSI), Pin 12 (MISO)
- **Control Pins**: Pin 8 (RESET), Pin 22 (DRDY) remain the same

### 2. Code Updates
- ✅ Updated `#define ADS_CS_PIN` from 21 to 10
- ✅ Replaced all hardcoded `digitalWriteFast(21, ...)` calls with `ADS_CS_PIN`
- ✅ Added Teensy 4.1 compatibility comments
- ✅ Verified SPI settings (2.5MHz is well within Teensy 4.1 capabilities)

### 3. Performance Improvements
- **CPU Speed**: 600MHz vs 72MHz (8.3x faster!)
- **Better timing precision** for microsecond delays
- **More processing headroom** for data analysis

## Files Modified

1. **`ads_1256_custom_library.ino`**
   - Updated pin definitions and comments
   - Added Teensy 4.1 compatibility notes

2. **`ads_1256_stuff.ino`**
   - Replaced hardcoded pin 21 references with `ADS_CS_PIN`
   - Updated comments for Teensy 4.1

3. **`ads1256_constants.ino`**
   - Added SPI speed documentation
   - Confirmed 2.5MHz is appropriate for ADS1256

## New Files Created

1. **`Teensy41_ADS1256_Pinout.md`** - Complete wiring diagram
2. **`Teensy41_Migration_Summary.md`** - This summary document

## Testing Checklist

### Hardware Setup
- [ ] Wire according to the new pinout (see `Teensy41_ADS1256_Pinout.md`)
- [ ] **Important**: Use Pin 10 for CS instead of Pin 21
- [ ] Verify 3.3V power supply to ADS1256
- [ ] Check all SPI connections (Pins 10, 11, 12, 13)
- [ ] Connect DRDY to Pin 22 and RESET to Pin 8

### Software Testing
- [ ] Upload the updated code to Teensy 4.1
- [ ] Open Serial Monitor at 115200 baud
- [ ] Verify initialization messages appear
- [ ] Check that register values are printed during setup
- [ ] Confirm ADC readings are being output

### Expected Serial Output
```
booting
done init
[Register values during calibration]
success
OFC0: [value]
OFC1: [value]
...
[Continuous ADC readings]
```

## Advantages of Teensy 4.1

1. **Much Faster Processing**: 600MHz vs 72MHz
2. **More Memory**: 1MB Flash, 1MB RAM vs 256KB Flash, 64KB RAM
3. **Better Floating Point**: Hardware FPU for faster calculations
4. **More Peripherals**: Additional SPI, I2C, UART interfaces
5. **USB Host Capability**: Can connect USB devices
6. **Ethernet**: Built-in Ethernet PHY (if using Teensy 4.1)

## Potential Optimizations for Teensy 4.1

Since you now have much more processing power, you could consider:

1. **Higher Sample Rates**: The ADS1256 can go up to 30kSPS
2. **Real-time Processing**: FFT, filtering, or signal analysis
3. **Data Logging**: Store to SD card or send over Ethernet
4. **Multiple ADCs**: Control several ADS1256 chips simultaneously
5. **Higher Baud Rates**: Use 921600 or higher for serial communication

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Double-check the CS pin** - This is the most common issue (Pin 10, not 21)
2. **Verify power supply** - ADS1256 needs clean 3.3V
3. **Check SPI connections** - Use a multimeter to verify continuity
4. **Monitor DRDY signal** - Should toggle when conversions complete
5. **Serial output** - Should see initialization messages and register values

## Need Help?

If you run into any issues:
1. Check the wiring against `Teensy41_ADS1256_Pinout.md`
2. Verify the serial output matches expected patterns
3. Use a logic analyzer or oscilloscope to check SPI signals if available

Your code is now ready for Teensy 4.1! The migration should be seamless with significantly better performance.
